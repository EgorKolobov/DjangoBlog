# DjangoBlog

DjangoBlog is my personal pet-project, which I decided to make in order to practice Django framework and tell a bit about myself as a developer.

## Heroku
The latest working version of DjangoBlog will always be deployed on Heroku.
Check it out [here](https://egors-djangoblog.herokuapp.com/)  

## Future Updates
This project is relatively new, thus I will be adding new features and updating description quite often.
